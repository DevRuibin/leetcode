Leetcode soultions in Java

This is a repository for my leetcode solutions in Java. It is a nice way to keep track of my progree using github. You may ask me why am I bothering to do this? Well, I did't copy the questions and my solutions from Leetcode. I used a vs code plugin so I can write my soultions locally. It is more convenient I think. Here is the [plugin link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode).
